Project Proposal:

I'd like to continue using a fictitious organization that I've built
over my time at CTU. They are a bookstore located in Nebraska with 4
locations called Heartland Escapes. Heartland Escapes would like to
embark on an endeavor to bring their bookstore online through an
e-commerce website. I don't think that this is a trivial pursuit, since
this site will need to integrate with payment processors, and legacy
systems like their pre-existing inventory API. I'd also like to focus on
both the application software architecture, and the application
infrastructure architecture, hopefully resulting in an elegant, fully
qualified solution.

My plan is to use Google Cloud Platform to host their application, and
use software frameworks that I'm familiar with. I have decent domain
knowledge of e-commerce websites, and my experience should allow for
minimal domain/technology research.

Since this store is fictitious, I should be able to contact any
individual I need to (I'll just make them up). I can also reference
documents I've created from previous courses if need be.
